[] Commit hooks to sync with deduce? / Action

[] Incremental Parsing
  - On change
  - Lex the file
  - Compare to old token stream
  - Find the statement potentially effected
  - Parse statements from there
    - If possible, resync!
  

Problem: What about deletion from front?
i.e. Removing an import line?
This shouldn't reparse the whole file
  
So what state does the LSP need to maintain explicitly?
- token_list
- current_position to set at the start?
