[] Commit hooks to sync with deduce? / GH Action (My script is whack)

[] Operators
[] Semantic Tokens
[] Actual renaming of variables
  - Just run uniquify here? Would only work in the one file
  - Also need the location of the thing we're renaming somehow

[] Incremental Parsing
  - Currently reparses everything that comes after?
  - On change
  - Lex the file
  - Compare to old token stream
  - Find the statement potentially effected
  - Parse statements from there
    - If possible, resync!
  

Problem: What about deletion from front?
i.e. Removing an import line?
This shouldn't reparse the whole file
  - Problems with position sync, I think we're fine
  
So what state does the LSP need to maintain explicitly?
- token_list
- current_position to set at the start?
